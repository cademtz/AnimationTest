# AnimationTest
Primitive animation software written from scratch in C for Windows and no extra libraries.

#### Now compiles with clang! (Windows theme fixing manifest not included)

Use `clang.sh` or directly run `clang ezcompile.c`, just be sure to link necessary libs (See inside `clang.sh`)

##### Want to use other compilers?
Only `ezcompile.c` is needed. As mentioned above, link all required libs.
